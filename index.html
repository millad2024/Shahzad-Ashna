<div><a name="s1"><h1 class="header2">Captain and fisherman</h1></a></div>
<div><p class="pra2">The cautious captain of a small ship had to go along a coast with which he was unfamiliar , so he 
    tried to find a qualified pilot to guide him. He went ashore in one of the small ports where his 
    ship stopped, and a local fisherman pretended that he was one because he needed some money. 
    The captain took him on board and let him tell him where to steer the ship. 
    After half an hour the captain began to suspect that the fisherman did not really know what he 
    was doing or where he was going so he said to him,' are you sure you are a qualified pilot? 
    'Oh, yes' answered the fisherman .'I know every rock on this part of the coast.' 
     Suddenly there was a terrible tearing sound from under the ship. 
     At once the fisherman added," and that's one of them." </p></div>

<div><a name="s2"><h1 class="header2">The Old man And whisky</h1></a></div>
<div><p class="pra2">Harry did not stop his car at some traffic-lights when they were red, and he hit another car. Harry 
    jumped out and went to it. There was an old man in the car. He was very frightened and said to 
    Harry, "what are you doing? You nearly killed me.!" 
    "yes" Harry answered, "I'm very sorry." He took a bottle out of his car and said ,"Drink some of 
    this. then you'll feel better." He gave the man some whisky, and the man drank it ,but then he 
    shouted again, "you nearly killed me!" 
    Harry gave him the bottle again, and the old man drank a lot of the whisky. Then he smiled and 
    said to Harry ,"Thank you .I feel much better now .but why aren't you drinking?" 
    "oh, well" Harry answered ,"I donâ€™t want any whisky now. I'm going to sit here and wait for the police."</p></div>

<div><a name="s3"><h1 class="header2">I can never find shoes for my feet</h1></a></div>
<div><p class="pra2">One of Harry's feet was bigger than the other. 'I can never find boots and shoes for my feet,' he 
    said to his friend Dick. 
    'Why don't you go to a sho~maker?' Dick said. 'A good one can make you the right shoes.' 
    'I've never been to a shoemaker,' Harry said. 'Aren't they very expensive?' 
    'No,' Dick said, 'some of them aren't. There's a good one in our village, and he's quite cheap. 
    Here's his address.'He wrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to Harry. 
    Harry went to the shoemaker in Dick's village a few days later, and the shoemaker made him 
    some shoes. 
    Harry went to the shop again a week later and looked at the shoes. Then he said to the shoemaker 
    angrily, 'You're a silly man! I said, "Make one shoe bigger than the other," but you've made one 
    smaller than the other!'  </p></div>

<div><a name="s4"><h1 class="header2">Destiny </h1></a></div>
<div><p class="pra2">During a momentous battle, a Japanese general decided to attack even though his army was 
    greatly outnumbered. He was confident they would win, but his men were filled with doubt. 
    On the way to the battle, they stopped at a religious shrine. After praying with the men, the 
    general took out a coin and said, "I shall now toss this coin. If it is heads, we shall win. If it is 
    tails we shall lose." 
    "Destiny will now reveal itself." 
    He threw the coin into the air and all watched intently as it landed. It was heads. The soldiers 
    were so overjoyed and filled with confidence that they vigorously attacked the enemy and were 
    victorious. 
    After the battle. a lieutenant remarked to the general, "No one can change destiny." 
    "Quite right," the general replied as he showed the lieutenant the coin, which had heads on both 
    sides.
