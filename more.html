</h1><a name="1"></a><h1 class="praheader">Do You Know Who I am </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">One day a student was taking a very difficult essay exam. At the end of the test, the prof asked 
        all the students to put their pencils down and immediately hand in their tests. The young man 
        kept writing furiously, although he was warned that if he did not stop immediately he would be 
        disqualified. He ignored the warning, finished the test. Minutes later, and went to hand the test to 
        his instructor. The instructor told him he would not take the test. 
        The student asked, "Do you know who I am?" 
        The prof said, "No and I don't care." 
        The student asked again, "Are you sure you don't know who I am?" 
        The prof again said no. Therefore, the student walked over to the pile of tests, placed his in the 
        middle, then threw the papers in the air "Good" the student said, and walked out. He passed.</p>

    <a name="2"></a><h1 class="praheader">The purpose of life </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">A long time ago, there was an Emperor who told his horseman that if he could ride on his horse 
        and cover as much land area as he likes, then the Emperor would give him the area of land he has 
        covered. 
        Sure enough, the horseman quickly jumped onto his horse and rode as fast as possible to cover as 
        much land area as he could. He kept on riding and riding, whipping the horse to go as fast as 
        possible. When he was hungry or tired, he did not stop because he wanted to cover as much area 
        as possible. 
        Came to a point when he had covered a substantial area and he was exhausted and was dying. 
        Then he asked himself, "Why did I push myself so hard to cover so much land area? Now I am 
        dying and I only need a very small area to bury myself." 
        The above story is similar with the journey of our Life. We push very hard everyday to make 
        more money, to gain power and recognition. We neglect our health , time with our family and to 
        appreciate the surrounding beauty and the hobbies we love. 
        One day when we look back , we will realize that we don't really need that much, but then we 
        cannot turn back time for what we have missed. 
        Life is not about making money, acquiring power or recognition . Life is definitely not about 
        work! Work is only necessary to keep us living so as to enjoy the beauty and pleasures of life. 
        Life is a balance of Work and Play, Family and Personal time. You have to decide how you want 
        to balance your Life. Define your priorities, realize what you are able to compromise but always 
        let some of your decisions be based on your instincts. Happiness is the meaning and the purpose 
        of Life, the whole aim of human existence. But happiness has a lot of meaning. Which king of 
        definition would you choose? Which kind of happiness would satisfy your high-flyer soul? </p>

    <a name="3"></a> <h1 class="praheader">I was just checking my performance </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and pulled it over to the telephone. 
        He climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the buttons on the phone and proceeded to 
        punch in seven digits. 
        The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation: The boy asked, "Lady, Can you give 
        me the job of cutting your lawn? The woman replied, "I already have someone to cut my lawn." 
        "Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now." replied 
        boy. The woman responded that she was very satisfied with the person who was presently cutting 
        her lawn. 
        The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even sweep your curb and your 
        sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in all of Palm beach, Florida." Again the 
        woman answered in the negative. 
        With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver. The store-owner, who was listening 
        to all, walked over to the boy and said, "Son... I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and 
        would like to offer you a job." 
        The little boy replied, "No thanks, I was just checking my performance with the job I already 
        have. I am the one who is working for that lady, I was talking to!" </p>

    <a name="4"></a><h1 class="praheader">Date of Birth </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">Joe Richards finished school when he was 18, and then his father said to him, 'You've passed 
        your examinations now,Joe, and you got good marks in them. Now go and get some good work. 
        They're looking for clever people at the bank in the town. The clerks there get quite a IN of 
        money now.' 
        A few days later, Joe went to the bank and asked for work there. A man took him into a small 
        room and gave him some questions on a piece of paper. Joe wrote his answers on the paper, and 
        then he gave them to the man. 
        The man looked at them for a few minutes, and then he took a pen and said toJoe, 'Your birthday 
        was on the 12th of June, Mr Richards?' 
        'Yes, sir,' Joe said. 
        'What year?' the man asked. 'Oh, every year, sir,' Joe said.</p>

    <p class="pracontain">Fred works in a factory. He does not have a wife, and he gets quite a lot of money every week. 
        He loves cars, and has a new one every year. He likes driving very fast, and he always buys 
        small, fast, red cars. He sometimes takes his mother out in them, and then she always says, 'But, 
        Fred, why do you drive these cars? We're almost sitting on the road!' 
        When Fred laughs and is happy. He likes being very near the road. 
        Fred is very tall and very fat. 
        Last week he came out of a shop and went to his car. There was a small boy near it. He was 
        looking at the beautiful red car. Then he looked up and saw Fred. 
        'How do you get into that small car?' he asked him. Fred laughed and said, 'I don't get into it. I 
        put it on.' </p>

    <a name="6"></a><h1 class="praheader">Success – Socrates</h1>
    <p class="pracontain">A young man asked Socrates the secret of success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near 
        the river the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the 
        river. When the water got up to their neck, Socrates took the young man by surprise and swiftly 
        ducked him into the water. 
        The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started 
        turning blue. Socrates pulled the boy’s head out of the water and the first thing the young man 
        did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. 
        Socrates asked him, "what did you want the most when you were there?" The boy replied, "Air". 
        Socrates said, "That is the secret of success! When you want success as badly as you wanted the 
        air, then you will get it!" There is no other secret</p>

    <a name="7"></a> <h1 class="praheader">Smart Soldier </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">Fred was a young soldier in a big camp. During the week they always worked very hard, but it 
        was Saturday, and all the young soldiers were free, so their officer said to them, 'You can go into 
        the town this afternoon, but first I'm going to inspect you.’
        Fred came to the officer, and the officer said to him, 'Your hair's very long. Go to the barber and 
        then come back to me again. 
        Fred ran to the barber's shop, but it was closed because it was Saturday. Fred was very sad for a 
        few minutes, but then he smiled and went back to the officer. 
        'Are my boots clean now, sir?' he asked. 
        The officer did not look at Fred's hair. He looked at his boots and said, 'Yes, they're much better 
        now. You can go out. And next week, first clean your boots, and then come to me!'</p>

    <a name="8"></a><h1 class="praheader">drinking milk is dangerous </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">George was sixty years old, and he was ill. He was always tired, and his face was always very 
        red. He did not like doctors, but last month his wife said to him, 'don’t be stupid, George. Go and 
        see Doctor Brown. 
        George said, 'No,' but last week he was worse, and he went to the doctor. 
        Dr Brown examined him and then said to him, 'You drink too much. Stop drinking whisky, and 
        drink milk.' 
        George liked whisky, and he did not like milk. 'I'm not a baby!' he always said to his wife. 
        Now he looked at Dr Brown and said, 'But drinking milk is dangerous, doctor’. 
        The doctor laughed and said, 'Dangerous? How can drinking milk be dangerous?’ 
        'Well, doctor,' George said, 'it killed one of my best friends last year.' 
        The doctor laughed again and said, 'How did it do that?' 
        'The cow fell on him,' George said. </p>

    <a name="9"></a><h1 class="praheader">Cowboy </h1>
    <p class="pracontain">A cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. Unfortunately, the locals always 
        had a habit of picking on strangers. When he finished his drink, he found his horse had been 
        stolen. 
        He went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without 
        even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling. "Which one of you sidewinders stole my 
        horse?!?!? " he yelled with surprising forcefulness. No one answered. "Alright, I’m gonna have 
        another beer, and if my horse ain’t back outside by the time I finish, I’m gonna do what I dun in 
        Texas! And I don’t like to have to do what I dun in Texas! “. Some of the locals shifted 
        restlessly. The man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse had been 
        returned to the post. He saddled up and started to ride out of town. The bartender wandered out 
        of the bar and asked, “Say partner, before you go... what happened in Texas?” The cowboy 
        turned back and said, “I had to walk home.</p>

    <a name="10"></a><h1 class="praheader">All Depends On Your Perspective</h1>
    <p class="pracontain">A professor stood before her Philosophy 101 class and had some items in front of 
        her. When the class began, wordlessly, she picked up a very large and empty 
        mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. 
        She then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the 
        professor picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. She shook the 
        jar lightly. 
        The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. She 
        then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. 
        The professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, 
        the sand filled up everything else. She then asked once more if the jar was full. 
        The students responded with a unanimous - yes. 
        The professor then produced two cans of liquid chocolate from under the table 
        and proceeded to pour the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the 
        empty space between the sand. The students laughed. 
        "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize 
        that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the 
        important things - - your family, your spouse, your health, your children, your 
        friends, your favorite passions - - things that if everything 
        else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. 
        "The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your 
        car." "The sand is everything else - - the small stuff." 
        "If you put the sand into the jar first," she continued, "there is no room for the 
        pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time 
        and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are 
        important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. 
        "Take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter. Set your priorities. 
        The rest is just sand." 
        One student raised her hand and inquired what the chocolate represented. 
        The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no 
        matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for chocolate!" </p>
